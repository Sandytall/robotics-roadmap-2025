# ðŸ¤– Robotics Roadmap 2025 (Aug 19 â€“ Nov 15)

Daily plan from **foundations â†’ robotics core â†’ applications â†’ specialization**, with tiny, concrete steps in **Python & C++**.
Track progress with daily logs and weekly miniâ€‘projects. Use this as a public learning portfolio.

## ðŸ“… Phases
- **Phase 1: Foundations (Aug 19 â€“ Sep 8)** â€” Python, C++, Math, Core CV
- **Phase 2: Core Robotics (Sep 9 â€“ Oct 6)** â€” ROS2, TF2, LiDAR, Fusion
- **Phase 3: Applications (Oct 7 â€“ Nov 3)** â€” SLAM, Nav2, AMR, Deployment
- **Phase 4: Specialization (Nov 4 â€“ Nov 15)** â€” Advanced CV/AI/ML/RL

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Deliverables
- **Computer Vision Pipeline** â€” Feature tracking + depth + object detection
- **LiDAR SLAM System** â€” PCL + Cartographer + obstacle detection
- **ROS2 Nav2 Robot** â€” TurtleBot3 end-to-end (mapping â†’ planning â†’ docking)
- **Multi-Robot Fleet Simulation** â€” Isaac Sim fleet with task allocation + safety
- **Capstone (Jetson)** â€” Full AMR stack: fusion + SLAM + Nav2 + deploy

## ðŸ§­ How to use this repo
1. Create a branch per day: `git checkout -b day-XX`
2. Work through the checklist in `logs/DayXX.md`
3. Commit code + images to the matching `phase*/week*/dayXX-*` folder
4. Push and tag weekly miniâ€‘projects in `projects/`
5. Keep environments pinned (Python `requirements.txt`, ROS2/Docker tags)
